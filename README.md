#### ActivityLifeCycle

    Activity is one of the building blocks of Android OS. In simple words Activity is a screen that user interact with. 
    Every Activity in android has lifecycle like created, started, resumed, paused, stopped or destroyed.
    These different states are known as Activity Lifecycle. 
    In other words we can say Activity is a class pre-written in Java Programming.

##### Short description of Activity Lifecycle example:

onCreate() – Called when the activity is first created

onStart() – Called just after it’s creation or by restart method after onStop(). Here Activity start becoming visible to user

onResume() – Called when Activity is visible to user and user can interact with it

onPause() – Called when Activity content is not visible because user resume previous activity

onStop() – Called when activity is not visible to user because some other activity takes place of it

onRestart() – Called when user comes on screen or resume the activity which was stopped

onDestroy – Called when Activity is not in background
